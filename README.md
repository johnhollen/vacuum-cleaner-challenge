# Vacuum Cleaner Code Challenge

## How to build and run

Install dependencies:

```shell
$ npm install
```

Run the app:

```shell
$ npm start
```

The `npm start` command is an alias for:

```shell
$ tsc && node ./dist/index.js
```

Which both compiles and runs the app.

## Run tests

Run all tests:

```shell
$ npm test
```

Run all tests with coverage report:

```shell
$ npm run test:coverage
```

Start jest in watch mode:

```shell
$ npm run test:watch
```
